# lstm_streamflow

This repository implements a Matlab version of LSTMs for CAMELS streamflow simulation. It is not part of any current or future publication, and is just playground code for an unsophisticated implementation of LSTM-based Hydrology. Anyone is welcome to use this working code, but I make no promises about its quality or reliabilty. 

Tensorflow and Pytorch versions of this experiment are expected in upcoming papers, and those more reliable sets of LSTM for CAMELS codes will be made public once the papers are published.
